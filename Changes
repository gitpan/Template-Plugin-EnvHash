Revision history for Perl module Template::Plugin::EnvHash

1.06 - No longer sign dist
     - Document that env vars starting with _ are not supported and alter tests to filter out this case

1.05 - Pod Updates

1.04 - Remove unused use English which would impose a performance hit (at the
       very least on older Perls)
       (thanks to ask for reminding me about this)

1.03 - Added KNOWN ISSUES section to docs

1.02 - Added Test::Distribution tests, removed the 'manual' signature and pod tests,
       renumbered tests. 003_load.t becomes 02_isa.t as use test is no longer required.

1.01 - Fixed empty README file

1.00 - First release to CPAN.  Has all the features  i intended when i
       started writing it. Only changes i can think of are bug fixes 
       (although hopefully nobody will find any bug fixes), a move from
       a Test::Pod to Test::Distribution (waiting for a bug fix), and
       implementation of any requested enhancements.
